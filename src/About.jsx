      <p> Microsoft Technical Community was established in February 2018 with the vision of “Innovating, Inventing and Improvising” to educate fellow computer science enthusiasts about various aspects of the technical world. The goal was and is to create professionals out of amateurs and to teach not just Microsoft technologies but anything that is required for students to excel in their careers. We have come a long way since then, and still have many more goals to reach.</p>
