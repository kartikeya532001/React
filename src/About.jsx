      <p>The COVID-19 has resulted in schools and colleges to shut all across the world. Globally, over 1.2 billion students are out of the classroom. As a result, education has changed dramatically, with the distinctive rise of e-learning, whereby teaching is undertaken remotely and on digital platforms. </p>

      <p>In the wake of this global atrocity our team has worked upon one of the major challenges that students faced after covid-19 was over i.e. booking of hostel online as we know students faced a lot of difficulties finding right room and right facilities for them so that they can avail for but because of some government restrictions students werenâ€™t able to go that is why the need is to create a platform so that students are able to see and rent rooms through an online portal. </p>
